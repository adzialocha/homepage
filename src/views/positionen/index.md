The Y-E-S collective took over the curation of the music periodical Positionen for their 130th edition. We printed some excerpts from the Y-E-S catalogue and asked 6 writers to approach the topic of art and resistance under the title Politiken Poetiken.

![Positionen Politiken Poetiken](/positionen/positionen.jpg)

Included are: a text on art as resistance in Iran by Hesam Salamat; a poetic portrait of the Brazilian performance artist and theorist Eleonora Fabi√£o by Maikon K; a text on her experience as a performer in Pope. L's Misconceptions by Leonie Chima Emeka; an analysis of choreographies in queer protests in Poland by Jennifer Ramme; a text on strategies of resistance in the artistic work of BIPOC composers by Anthony R. Green; and a text on the use of the Chinese national anthem and its politicisation in works of Hong Kong artists by Clara Cheung.

We will celebrate the issue at our release party in Silent Green during this years MaerzMusik festival on 22/03/22.
