Y-E-S is an acronym with many meanings, from Yale Exodus Service to Your Easy Sex, and a group of people with a background in music. We collect and publish scores on the shared platform y-e-s.org. For us, a score is by no means limited to the realm of music and could just as well be performance instructions, a recipe, code, choreography, a surprise file package, video games, film scripts, some poetry, or an online tutorial.

We publish roughly every month and releases can be freely downloaded. From time to time we organize shows or festivals related to our publishing practice. Currently we are Stellan Veloce, Neo HÃ¼lcker, Laure M. Hiendl, Andreas Dzialocha and Kaj Duncan David.
