Machine learning products are mainly defined by a technological elite and commercial startup industry, encoding the politics of technology which inform and (re-)produce rulesets in our world and culture. Our focus will be to produce non-commercial ML forms of failure, creative misunderstandings, playfulness and anti-narration using its efficient symbolic architecture to reflect human / non-human knowledge and beauty.

AI UNIT uses modern startup- and platform technology and infrastructure to operate ML while developing own open source projects and gathering data for artistic and political purpose. Our aim is to strenghten a debate outside of a technological and commercial field, connect critical channels of publication and reflection with production of ML based art and activism, both in virtual space and in reality.
